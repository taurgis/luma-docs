# Welcome to Luma Docs

Luma Docs is a modern, fast, and beautiful documentation platform built with React, MDX, and Vite. It provides a seamless experience for both content creators and readers.

## Feature Highlights

Luma Docs is opinionated yet flexible. Below is a curated tour; each item links to a deeper showcase page so this site both **documents** and **demonstrates** the platform.

| Category | Highlights | Deep Dive |
| -------- | ---------- | --------- |
import { BaseLink } from "@/components";

| Category | Highlights | Deep Dive |
| -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Authoring | MDX + React components, fenced code → syntax highlight, component imports via aliases | <BaseLink to="/guides/components/">Component Showcase</BaseLink> |
| Content Pipeline | Deterministic multi-step build (versions → routes → css → search → sitemap → SSG) | <BaseLink to="/guides/architecture/">Architecture & Build</BaseLink> |
| Navigation | Automatic route generation from folder structure, ordering via `order` frontmatter, smart sidebar flattening | <BaseLink to="/guides/advanced/">Advanced Features</BaseLink> |
| Versioning | Folder-based snapshots, switcher, archived banners, search scoping & fallback routing | <BaseLink to="/guides/versioning/">Versioning Guide</BaseLink> |
| Search | Zero-config local index, instant modal (⌘K), version scope toggle, heading deep-linking | <BaseLink to="/guides/search/">Search Showcase</BaseLink> |
| SEO | Frontmatter + inline `<SEO />` overrides, JSON-LD, automatic tags, sitemap generation | <BaseLink to="/seo-examples/">SEO Examples</BaseLink> |
| Deployment | Auto base-path detection, GitHub Pages native workflow, subfolder previews | <BaseLink to="/guides/deployment/">Deployment & Base Path</BaseLink> |
| Customization | Central `config.ts`, Tailwind theme, branded components, feature flags | <BaseLink to="/guides/customization/">Customization Guide</BaseLink> |

## Getting Started

To get started with Luma Docs, simply create MDX files in the `content/pages` directory. Each file will automatically become a page in your documentation site.

### File Structure

```
content/
    pages/
        index.mdx                 # Home page (/)
        getting-started/
            index.mdx               # /getting-started/
        guides/
            index.mdx               # /guides/
            advanced.mdx            # /guides/advanced/
            components.mdx          # /guides/components/
            versioning.mdx          # /guides/versioning/
```

### Frontmatter

Each MDX file can include frontmatter to specify metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "Page description for SEO"
order: 1
---
```

- `title`: The page title (used in navigation and SEO)
- `description`: Page description for SEO
- `order`: Sort order for navigation (lower numbers appear first)

## Next Steps

1. Explore the showcase guides above (start with <BaseLink to="/getting-started/">Getting Started</BaseLink>).
2. Open `content/pages/` in your editor and create a new folder + `index.mdx`.
3. Run `npm run dev` – the dev script regenerates routes & search automatically.
4. Snapshot a release with `npm run snapshot:version -- v1.0` (or your version label) when you cut a milestone.
5. Commit & push; the GitHub Pages workflow builds and deploys.

Welcome to the future of documentation – where the docs are their own proof of capability.
