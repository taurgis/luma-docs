# Architecture & Build Pipeline

Luma Docs orchestrates a **deterministic multi-step content pipeline**. Each step produces an artifact that the next can consume — keeping builds reproducible and easy to debug.

## Pipeline Overview

```text
versions → routes → css → search → sitemap → ssg
```

| Step     | Script                  | Output                                  | Purpose                                                                |
| -------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Versions | `generate:versions`     | `src/generated-versions.ts`             | Enumerates archived version labels for UI + routing + search filtering |
| Routes   | `generate:routes`       | `src/generated-routes.tsx` + `.meta.ts` | Discovers MDX pages, extracts frontmatter, attaches version + meta     |
| CSS      | `build:css`             | `src/components/public/index.css`       | Tailwind + typography utilities compiled once                          |
| Search   | `generate:search-index` | `src/generated-search-index.ts`         | Static JSON-like index of headings + snippets + version                |
| Sitemap  | `generate:sitemap`      | `dist/sitemap.xml`                      | SEO discovery + can be extended for priority/archived handling         |
| SSG      | `vite-react-ssg build`  | `dist/**/*.html`                        | Pre-rendered HTML + hydration entry points                             |

All of this is wrapped by `npm run build` and by the `dev` script (which runs incremental rebuilds as needed).

## Why Separate Steps?

- **Isolation**: Fail fast in the earliest script that breaks (e.g. malformed frontmatter).
- **Cacheability**: Intermediate artifacts let future tooling (analytics, lint, link checkers) run without parsing raw MDX again.
- **Determinism**: Each stage has a single responsibility, simplifying reasoning about regressions.

## Route Generation Details

The route generator:

1. Scans `content/pages/` for current docs.
2. Scans `content/versions/<label>/` for archived snapshots.
3. Normalizes slugs (`/foo/bar/`) and paths (`/foo/bar`).
4. Emits React route components (lazy loaded) plus a separate lightweight metadata file.
5. Attaches `version` for downstream consumers (search, badges, switcher, SEO tweaks).

## Frontmatter Extraction

Frontmatter is parsed and validated (see `validate:frontmatter`). Only whitelisted keys make it into meta. This keeps the **runtime lean** and prevents accidental leakage of experimental flags.

## Search Index Structure

Each entry contains:

```ts
// Shape of each search index record (illustrative only)
// (Removed local interface declaration to satisfy lint rule)
// {
//   path: string;
//   pageTitle: string;
//   heading: string;
//   headingId?: string;
//   content: string;
//   version?: string;
// }
```

No network calls, no 3rd-party service — pure static asset.

## Version Awareness

Version scoping is **structural**, not dynamic rewriting. This means your old snapshots are immutable references of history — a huge win for reproducibility.

## Extensibility Points

| Need                                  | Hook                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Add lint for broken internal links    | New script after `generate:routes`          |
| Exclude very old versions from search | Filter in `generate-search-index.js`        |
| Add RSS or Atom feed                  | After sitemap (shares route meta)           |
| Pre-compute Algolia index             | Replace local search stage with remote push |

## Debugging Tips

```bash
npm run generate:routes -- --debug  # (hypothetical future flag)
node src/tools/generate-search-index.js > /tmp/index.json
```

Because artifacts are plain TS/JS files, you can open them directly to inspect structure.

## Future Ideas

- Parallelization (routes + css) where I/O bound
- Build manifest for plugin ecosystem
- Incremental sitemap updates

The pipeline is intentionally **minimal but explicit** — easy to extend without becoming a black box.
