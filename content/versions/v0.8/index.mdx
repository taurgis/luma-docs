# Luma Docs v0.8

> Archived snapshot. Missing later features (multi-step pipeline, version switcher UI, enhanced search index, unified base path resolver).

Early pre-1.0 version of the docs platform.

## Characteristics

- Basic MDX routing prototype
- No version switcher
- Minimal styling

## Upgrading (Historical Note)

Move to v0.9 or (preferably) 1.0+ to get improved build scripts, base path resolver, version switcher, and search enhancements.
