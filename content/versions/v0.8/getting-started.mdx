# Getting Started (v0.8)

> Archived version. Commands reflect early setup; later versions run an automated pipeline (versions, routes, CSS, search, sitemap) behind `npm run dev` / `npm run build`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Feature set was still evolving; expect configuration differences versus later versions.
