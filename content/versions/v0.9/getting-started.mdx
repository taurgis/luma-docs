# Getting Started (v0.9)

> Archived version. Later releases introduce a coordinated multi-step build pipeline (versions, routes, search index, sitemap) that runs automatically inside the `dev` and `build` scripts.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use 1.0+ for finalized configuration conventions (pipeline + base path resolver).
