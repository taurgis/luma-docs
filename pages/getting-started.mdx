# Getting Started

This guide will help you get up and running with Luma Docs quickly.

## SEO Features

Luma Docs now includes comprehensive SEO support through frontmatter metadata. You can specify SEO attributes in your MDX files:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "Your page description for search engines"
keywords: "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3"
ogType: "article"
ogImage: "/path/to/your/image.png"
twitterCard: "summary_large_image"
author: "Author Name"
publishedTime: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
section: "Your Section"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
---
```

You can also override SEO settings directly in your MDX content using the `<SEO>` component:

<SEO 
  title="Custom Page Title Override"
  description="This description will override the frontmatter description"
  keywords="custom, override, seo"
/>

## Installation

1. Clone or download the Luma Docs template
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Creating Content

Content is written in MDX format, which allows you to combine Markdown with React components.

### Basic Markdown

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `Inline code`

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function hello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### React Components

You can also use React components directly in your MDX:

```jsx
<div className="bg-blue-100 p-4 rounded">
  This is a custom component!
</div>
```

## Navigation

Navigation is automatically generated based on your file structure and frontmatter. Pages are sorted by the `order` field in frontmatter, then alphabetically.

## Deployment

To deploy to GitHub Pages:

1. Build the site:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy the `dist` folder to your GitHub Pages branch

The site is configured to work with GitHub Pages subfolder deployments (e.g., `username.github.io/repository-name`).
