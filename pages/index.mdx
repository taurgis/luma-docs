# Welcome to Luma Docs

Luma Docs is a modern, fast, and beautiful documentation platform built with React, MDX, and Vite. It provides a seamless experience for both content creators and readers.

## Features

- **MDX Support**: Write content in MDX format with the full power of React components
- **Automatic Routing**: Pages are automatically added to routes based on file structure
- **Fast Static Generation**: Built with Vite React SSG for lightning-fast performance
- **GitHub Pages Ready**: Optimized for deployment on GitHub Pages
- **Beautiful Design**: Clean, responsive design with excellent typography
- **Search Functionality**: Built-in search to help users find content quickly

## Getting Started

To get started with Luma Docs, simply create MDX files in the `pages` directory. Each file will automatically become a page in your documentation site.

### File Structure

```
pages/
├── index.mdx           # Home page (/)
├── getting-started.mdx # /getting-started/
└── guides/
    ├── index.mdx       # /guides/
    └── advanced.mdx    # /guides/advanced/
```

### Frontmatter

Each MDX file can include frontmatter to specify metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "Page description for SEO"
order: 1
---
```

- `title`: The page title (used in navigation and SEO)
- `description`: Page description for SEO
- `order`: Sort order for navigation (lower numbers appear first)

## Next Steps

- Create your first MDX page
- Customize the navigation structure
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

Welcome to the future of documentation!
