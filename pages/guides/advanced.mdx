# Advanced Features

Luma Docs comes with several advanced features that make it powerful and flexible for documentation sites.

## MDX Components

You can create custom React components and use them in your MDX files. This allows for rich, interactive documentation.

### Example: Callout Component

You could create a callout component like this:

```jsx
function Callout({ type, children }) {
  const styles = {
    info: "bg-blue-50 border-blue-200 text-blue-800",
    warning: "bg-yellow-50 border-yellow-200 text-yellow-800",
    error: "bg-red-50 border-red-200 text-red-800",
  };

  return <div className={`border-l-4 p-4 ${styles[type]}`}>{children}</div>;
}

<Callout />;
```

## Code Highlighting

Code blocks are automatically highlighted using Prism.js with support for many languages:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: "admin" | "user";
}

function createUser(data: Partial<User>): User {
  return {
    name: "",
    email: "",
    role: "user",
    ...data,
  };
}

// Example invocation
createUser({})
```

## Table of Contents

The table of contents is automatically generated from your headings (h2 and h3) and appears in the right sidebar on desktop.

## Search

The built-in search functionality indexes all your content and provides fast, client-side search results.

## Performance

- **Static Generation**: All pages are pre-rendered at build time
- **Code Splitting**: JavaScript is automatically split into smaller chunks
- **Optimized Assets**: Images and other assets are optimized for fast loading
- **Minimal Runtime**: Very little JavaScript is required for the site to function

## SEO Optimization

- Automatic sitemap generation
- Meta tags from frontmatter
- Structured data markup
- Fast loading times

These features combine to create a documentation platform that's both powerful for authors and fast for readers.
