1. **Development Optimization** (Vite Expert)
   - Fast development server with HMR for MDX content
   - Optimized production builds with automatic content generation
   - Advanced TypeScript configuration for React 19

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml - Optimized for Luma Docs
name: Deploy Luma Docs Documentation Site
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:

          publish_dir: ./dist
          cname: docs.example.com
```

## ï¿½ Configuration System

### Centralized Configuration
Luma Docs uses a centralized configuration system in `config.ts` that eliminates hardcoded values throughout the application:

```typescript
// config.ts structure
export const config = {
  site: {
    name: "Site Name",
    title: "Site Title", 
    description: "Site Description",
    version: "1.0.0",
  },
  branding: {
    logo: { text: "Brand", accent: "Name" }
  },
  links: {
    github: "https://github.com/user/repo"
  },
  navigation: {
    showVersionBadge: true,
    showGitHubLink: true,
  }
};
```

### Configuration Integration Points
- **Components**: All React components import and use config values
- **HTML Template**: Build script injects config values into `index.html`
- **Build Process**: Configuration affects build behavior and asset generation
- **Navigation**: Dynamic menu generation based on config settings
- **Branding**: Consistent branding across all UI elements

### Build-Time Configuration Processing
The `update-html-template.js` script processes the HTML template during build:
- Replaces `{{SITE_TITLE}}` with `config.site.title`
- Replaces `{{SITE_DESCRIPTION}}` with `config.site.description`
- Ensures consistent metadata across all generated pages
