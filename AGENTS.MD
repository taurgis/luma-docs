   - Custom domain configuration for documentation sites
   - Performance monitoring and alerting for live documentation

### Example Workflow Integration (Modern Native GitHub Pages)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml - Modern native Pages + separation of concerns
name: Docs CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read # Needed to checkout
  pages: write # Required for deployment
  id-token: write # Required by deploy-pages for OIDC

concurrency:
  group: pages-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Derive base path
        id: base
        run: |
          if [[ "${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}" =~ github\.io$ ]]; then
            echo "base=/" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          else
            repo=$(echo "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" | cut -d'/' -f2)
            echo "base=/$repo/" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          fi

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm

      # Vite Expert: dependency installation & quality gates
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit

      - name: Lint & Typecheck
        run: |
          npm run lint
          npm run type-check

      # GitHub Pages Expert + Vite Expert: subfolder-aware build
      - name: Build static site
        env:
          VITE_BASE_PATH: ${{ steps.base.outputs.base }}
          GITHUB_REPOSITORY: ${{ github.repository }}
        run: npm run build:subfolder

      # (Optional) place for link/a11y checks before deployment
      # - name: Check links
      #   run: npx lychee dist --no-progress --base dist

      - name: Upload build artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./dist

  deploy:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

Notes:

- Base path logic centralized in a single early step and exported via `VITE_BASE_PATH`.
- Clear separation between build and deploy jobs enables future additions (bundle analysis, accessibility checks) without touching deployment permissions.

## ðŸ›  Configuration System

### Centralized Configuration

Luma Docs uses a centralized configuration system in `config.ts` that eliminates hardcoded values throughout the application:

```typescript
// config.ts structure
export const config = {
  site: {
    name: "Site Name",
    title: "Site Title",
    description: "Site Description",
    version: "1.0.0",
  },
  branding: {
    logo: { text: "Brand", accent: "Name" },
  },
  links: {
    github: "https://github.com/user/repo",
  },
  navigation: {
    showVersionBadge: true,
    showGitHubLink: true,
  },
};
```

### Configuration Integration Points

- **Components**: All React components import and use config values
- **HTML Template**: Build script injects config values into `index.html`
- **Build Process**: Configuration affects build behavior and asset generation
- **Navigation**: Dynamic menu generation based on config settings
- **Branding**: Consistent branding across all UI elements

### Build-Time Configuration Processing

The `update-html-template.js` script processes the HTML template during build:

- Replaces `{{SITE_TITLE}}` with `config.site.title`
- Replaces `{{SITE_DESCRIPTION}}` with `config.site.description`
- Ensures consistent metadata across all generated pages

## ðŸ“‹ Luma Docs Specific Knowledge

### Build Process Understanding

Both agents should understand the current Luma Docs build sequence (no separate HTML template mutation step):

1. `generate:routes` â€“ Scan `pages/` directory and create `src/generated-routes.tsx` (includes frontmatter / SEO metadata)
2. `build:css` â€“ Compile Tailwind CSS with Typography plugin
3. `generate:search-index` â€“ Extract content and build search index
4. `generate:sitemap` â€“ Create SEO-friendly `sitemap.xml`
5. `vite-react-ssg build` â€“ Generate static HTML with React hydration & SEO meta tags injected via `components/SEO.tsx`

### Directory Structure Expertise

- **`pages/`**: MDX content files with automatic route generation
- **`components/`**: React components (Layout, Sidebar, Search, SEO, Breadcrumbs, TOC)
- **`scripts/`**: Build automation and content generation scripts
- **`src/generated-*`**: Auto-generated files (routes, search index)
- **`config.ts`**: Centralized site configuration (branding, links, features, SEO defaults)
- **`utils/`**: Shared utilities for routing, search, and base path handling

### Environment Configuration

- **Base Path Handling**: Dynamic detection from git remotes or environment variables (`VITE_BASE_PATH`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`)
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Standard dev (`npm run dev`), subfolder dev (`npm run dev:subfolder`), production & GitHub Pages subfolder builds (`npm run build:subfolder`)
- **Content Processing**: MDX + frontmatter, automatic navigation generation and breadcrumb derivation
- **Configuration System**: Centralized `config.ts` controlling branding, links, feature flags (e.g. `breadcrumbs`, `structuredDataBreadcrumbs`, `search`)
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and caching strategies
- **SEO Delivery**: Meta tags & JSON-LD generated at SSG time via `components/SEO.tsx` (replaces earlier template injection concept)
