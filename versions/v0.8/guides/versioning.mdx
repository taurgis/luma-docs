# Versioning

Luma Docs includes a **folder‑based multi-version documentation system** designed to keep the _current_ documentation clean while preserving historical releases for reference.

## Core Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current Version     | Content in `pages/` – label comes from `config.versions.current` (e.g. `v1.0`)            |
| Archived Versions   | Snapshots stored under `versions/<label>/` (e.g. `versions/v0.9/`)                        |
| Version Metadata    | Every route gets a `meta.version` field used by navigation, search, badges, and SEO logic |
| Version Switcher    | Automatically visible only when at least one archived version exists                      |
| Search Scope Toggle | Users can search only the current version or all versions                                 |
| Archived Banner     | Automatically shown on archived pages and adds `noindex` (unless overridden)              |

## Directory Structure

```
pages/                  # Current (stable) docs (label = config.versions.current)
versions/
  v0.9/                 # Archived snapshot
  v0.8/
```

Each MDX file from an archived version keeps its original relative path, so a page that was `/getting-started/` in the current version becomes `/v0.9/getting-started/` in the archive.

## Configuration (`config.ts`)

```ts
versions: {
  current: "v1.0",    // Label applied to root pages
  enableSwitcher: true,
  strategy: 'folder',
  hidden: [],          // Hide specific archived versions from switcher
  order: [],           // Optional explicit ordering (else semantic version sort)
}
```

## Creating a Snapshot

You can snapshot manually or use the automated helper script.

### Automated (Recommended)

```bash
# Snapshot current root content into versions/v1.0
npm run snapshot:version -- v1.0

# Snapshot and bump current label to v1.1 (so pages/ becomes v1.1)
npm run snapshot:version -- v1.0 --bump v1.1
```

The script performs:

1. Label validation (`vMAJOR[.MINOR[.PATCH]]`)
2. Copy `pages/` → `versions/<label>/`
3. Regenerate `src/generated-versions.ts`
4. Optional `--bump <next>` updates `config.ts` + regenerates routes

### Manual Workflow (Alternative)

```bash
NEW_VER=v1.0
mkdir -p versions/$NEW_VER
rsync -a pages/ versions/$NEW_VER/
# (Optional) update config.ts if starting work on next version
```

Then regenerate artifacts:

```bash
npm run generate:versions && npm run generate:routes && npm run generate:search-index
```

## Navigation Behavior

- Sidebar displays only the pages for the _active_ version (prevents cross-version noise)
- Version switcher hides automatically if there are no archived versions
- Archived versions can be excluded from the switcher via `config.versions.hidden`

## Search Behavior

| Scope        | Effect                                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Current      | Only routes where `meta.version === config.versions.current`             |
| All Versions | Includes archived results (archived entries show a neutral version pill) |

Each search index entry includes a `version` field. Version inference also runs as a fallback using the URL prefix (e.g. `/v0.9/...`).

## SEO & Indexing

Archived pages automatically receive:

- An in-page banner clarifying the content is from an older version
- `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` (unless frontmatter sets `noindex: false`)

If you want to direct search engines toward the current equivalent, add a `canonical` frontmatter field in the archived page pointing to the current URL.

```yaml
---
canonical: "/getting-started/"
noindex: false # Explicitly override the automatic archived noindex (use sparingly)
---
```

## Frontmatter Overrides

You can still customize per-page metadata in archived versions—Luma Docs does _not_ lock or mutate frontmatter when snapshotting.

Useful overrides:

- `title`: Add a legacy qualifier (e.g. "Getting Started (v0.9)")
- `noindex: false`: Preserve indexing for key legacy pages
- `canonical`: Point to current equivalent

## Release Flow Example

```bash
# Finish development of v1.0 in pages/

# Snapshot and bump to start v1.1
npm run snapshot:version -- v1.0 --bump v1.1

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: snapshot v1.0 and bump current to v1.1"

# Continue editing pages/ (now labeled v1.1 automatically)
```

## Safety & Idempotency

- The snapshot script refuses to overwrite an existing `versions/<label>` folder
- Labels must follow the `v<number>[.<number>[.<number>]]` pattern
- Route and versions files are regenerated to avoid stale metadata

## FAQ

**Q: Can I remove an archived version?**  
Yes—delete `versions/<label>/`, run `npm run generate:versions` and rebuild. (Links to that version will 404.)

**Q: Can I hide a version but keep it accessible?**  
Add the label to `config.versions.hidden`; it stays routable but disappears from the switcher.

**Q: Does search index get huge over time?**  
Potentially. You can prune very old versions or implement a custom size cap later.

**Q: How do I compare two versions?**  
Planned future enhancement: diff tooling is not yet built. You can use `git diff` between snapshot commits.

## Future Enhancements

Planned ideas:

- Cross-version diff component
- Version comparison landing page
- Sitemap prioritization / exclusion for archived versions

## Summary

The versioning system keeps the present focused while preserving history—automatic UI cues, search scoping, and SEO protections ensure users find the right content without confusion.
